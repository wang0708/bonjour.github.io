# CSS Zen Garden

## Introduction
[CSS Zen Garden](http://csszengarden.com) was created in 2003 by Dave Shea as a showcase of what can be accomplished through CSS-based design. 

## Objective
For this project, you will create and provide the CSS for your own CSS Zen Garden design, which will be applied to the provided HTML. You may design the page anyway you like, but the HTML file **CANNOT** be changed.

## Requirements
The following requirements must be met in order to complete the assignment successfully:

1. Download the [CSS Zen Garden starter files](https://github.com/MTM6230/css-zen-garden/archive/master.zip). The starter files contain an `index.html` file, and a `style.css` file. **No changes should be made to the `index.html` file.**
2. You may **NOT** change the HTML file in any way. 
3. Your design must be optimized for a variety of browsers, devices and screens sizes.
4. Your design must utilize Flexbox and/or CSS Grid in a meaningful way.
5. You may use a reset or normalize CSS by including the styles as part of your `style.css` file.
6. If you choose to use web fonts, which is encouraged, use only fonts that you have the rights to use. Fonts from Google Fonts are fine.
7. If you choose to use images or illustrations, use only ones you have the rights to use. Make sure that the images and illustrations are optimized. 
8. The use of CSS Frameworks (i.e. Bootstrap) or other CSS Libraries is forbidden.
